# The History #

The seraphite were once protectors of humankind, guardians protecting them from the darker corners of the world, mostly unseen except by a select few.  They maintained the peace for centuries until the day the seas boiled and the mountains cracked.  The seraphite went to explore the scar as protectors and came back out greedy, twisted and hungry for power.

The humans fought and defended, but with each Forlorn beast they killed, 3 more took its place.  After decades of fighting, the remaining human forces were distressed.  They were holed up in caves in the mountains with little hope of surviving another day.  But, just when desperation had reached a critical point, something unexpected happened.  The Forlorn abandoned their siege for reasons unknown and left the humans devastated lands.

Humans realized that the threat still remained, and so The Templar Legion was born and tasked by the remaining human residents with the job of seeking out and destroying all Forlorn and every incantation of their dark magic from the world.  Knights from across the continent banded together and seek out the Forlorn and their agents.

On an island far from the mainland a civilization that had so far escaped the bloodshed of the previous decades started experiencing strikes by the Forlorn on their lands.  The inhabitants of this island, The Children of Sarame, had long ago discovered a red glowing mineral in the volcanic mountains of their island, and had since perfected its use as a power source enabling convenience in domestic life, as well as ways to power weapons and armor.  The Forlorn's strikes seemed to focus more and more on The Children's mineral mines.

In the desert of the Waste, a tribe of humans stumbled upon an ancient speaking cat tribe, that have been living amongst oasis pools surrounded by red crystals.  Hundreds flock to the desert to worship the Tykon'long and pledge their souls to the New Path, a manuscript found that supposedly reveals the secrets to the future.  The Wastemen train with the cats, honing their fighting abilities to near human perfection and discovering their inner chakra to better prepare themselves for what they believe to be an oncoming apocalypse.  Strikes by The Forlorn on the desert people have been on the rise, with outlying oasis pools raided and stripped of their crystals.

A war is coming.
You must choose your people,
swear your fealty,
gather your army,
and fight to defend your home.
Dark times are upon us - only you can change their course....

# Ideas to discuss #

Do the magic shards feel too gemstone of macguffin-ish?  Having something that's the source of power for everyone and that gives The Forsaken a reason to sweep across the world might be a little too convenient.
