## The Forlorn ##

A conquesting power-hungry legion of creatures that were once armored shining seraphim that were twisted through their use and abuse of magic.  Some still display traces of their original angelic nature but are covered in glowing fissured dark armor with black wings (I'm thinking about the angels from The Darkness comic by topcow) others are hunched over with wings of bone or leathery skin.  Still others have had their wings removed and been enslaved, evolving into other creatures altogether through the years.  The Forlorn are primarily magic users but there are still some that have maintained their martial prowess.  Some possible units are scarred battlemages, beast-handlers, winged sword-wielding archons, or the pattern tracing shard-casters.

## Children of Sarame ##

Isolated Technology-Users.  Their attack animations would be explosions,
grenades, gunpowder weapons, etc. steampunk.. somewhere around after the industrial revolution.

## The Templar Legion ##

Anti-magic zealots. But the Watchers may seem boring to some because they won't have alot of over-the-top style attacks like the other factions.  Maybe we let them have some sort of war machines (catapults,etc).  I dunno, let me know what you think. Maybe the Watcher could be the standard "beginner" faction that is pretty much straight-forward to play (walk up to enemy and attack).

## The Tykon Wastemen ##

Chakra-Practitioners.  Wastemen have honed their bodies to super-human
levels and so are able to do things that normal humans are unable to
do.  Battle animations include jumping great distances, over-the-top
physical attacks (example: most animations in Disgaea, ninja movies).
We could include attacks that let them push enemies across a distance,
magic-like abilities (explosions, etc.) and also attacks that have a
cat-like look (claw gloves raking back and forth).
